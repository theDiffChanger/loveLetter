                        <p>Today, I was reflecting on the though that i might be crazy already. Since after we talked for a moment, your voice is constantly ringing in my head.</p>
                        <p>We shared a lot in regards with our situation, I was devastated when you talked abour your past traumas and i felt sorry about it.</p>

We grew each day as we progress sa atoang mga tawag, you're also trying hard na maibog ko nimo HAHAHAHAHA – now i belive that love; it's real, even with all the messiness of the world there are still things that can make me smile.</p>

                        <p>They say love is in the grand gestures, but I've found it's in the smallest details. It's in how you make my coffee just the way I like it. It's in the way you send me random texts throughout the day just to say you're thinking of me.</p>
                        <p>Your very efforts to make me smile, fall in love and also appreciates my works and your super green flag attitude is what keeps me motivated each day. I am thankful that today, in my latter days i got to know you my baby,babi and lovey.</p>
                        <p>These seemingly insignificant moments are the building blocks of our love story. They're the daily reminders that I am seen, appreciated, and cherished by you. Never underestimate the power of these small acts of love – they mean everything to me.</p>

                            With golden laughter in the air.
                            A voice so light, like rippling streams,
                            A soul that shines in endless dreams.
                            
                            Your words, a dance, a playful song,
                            Conversations bright and strong.
                            Each tale she weaves, each thought she shares,
                            A spark of wonder, free from cares.
                            
                            She sways to beats both soft and low,
                            My lofi tunes that gently flow.
                            She hums along, her heart in sync,
                            Lost in rhythms, on the brink.
                            
                            With every chat, time fades away,
                            Like fleeting stars at break of day.
                            My Ruby, dear, so full of light,
                            You make the world feel warm, feel right.</p>

                            A story vast—too bold to leave.

                        <p class="date text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">Present</p>
                        <p>Hello babi,</p>
                        <p>It began on an ordinary day, a fleeting moment in time, yet destiny has a way of weaving significance into the mundane. You entered my life not with grandeur, but with a presence that stirred something deep within me—something unexplainable yet undeniable. Our first words were simple, just another exchange in the sea of conversations, but they carried weight, an invisible pull that tethered me to you.
                            The days we spent together were like stolen moments from eternity. Time, which once felt like an endless march forward, suddenly paused when I was with you. It was as if the universe conspired to let me hold onto joy a little longer, to let me feel what it truly meant to be alive. I was happy—not just in the fleeting sense of the word, but in the kind of happiness that anchors itself into the soul. You were the melody that softened the noise of the world, the gentle warmth that made existence feel lighter.
                            And then, you left.
                            But please, do not carry the weight of guilt for it. I understand. We are all travelers in this life, bound by paths unknown, drawn by forces beyond our control. Some souls are meant to meet, to intertwine, even if only for a while, before they must part again. There is no bitterness in my heart, only gratitude—for the laughter we shared, the quiet moments of understanding, the love that needed no grand gestures to be real.
                            Wherever you are, know that I pray for you. Not just for your happiness, but for your peace, for your journey to be filled with light. Do not rush—life unfolds in its own time, and love, the kind that is meant for you, will arrive when the moment is right. As we once told each other, "take things slowly." Trust in the unfolding of your story.
                            To the man who will love you next, I leave this silent wish—that he may cherish you as you deserve to be cherished, that his love may not confine you but give you wings. May he understand the depth of your soul, and may he be a guiding light, not a fleeting shadow.
                            And as for me, I carry our memories with reverence, not as a burden, but as a gift. What we had was not in vain; love, in any form, is never wasted. The part of me that once held you has now taken flight. And now, it is time for me to do the same.
                            No matter where the winds take us, know this—you were loved, truly and deeply. And that love, though transformed, will remain.
                            Always.</p>

                        <p>My Baby, </p>
                        <p>You are the brightest light in my world, the melody in my quiet moments, the warmth that lingers in my heart. I love you not only for your beauty but for the soul that shines through your every word, your every laugh, your every gentle sigh. With you, conversations feel like poetry, and time feels like a song we never want to end.

                            Even if distance or fate pulls us apart, my heart will always beat in tune with yours. I will miss you in the hush of midnight, in the golden glow of the morning sun, in every soft lofi melody that once made you smile. My love for you is not bound by time or space—it is woven into the very fabric of my being, unshaken, unwavering.
                            
                            And so, even if I cannot hold your hand, I will hold you in my prayers. I will whisper your name to the heavens, asking for your happiness, your peace, your every dream to come true. I will love you from near or far, not to bind you, but to bless you—to wish you joy in every step you take, to hope that love surrounds you always.
                            
                            No matter where life leads us, my love for you will remain—a quiet promise, an endless devotion, a song that never fades.</p>
